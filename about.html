            <h2>Personal Details</h2>
            <p>Hi, I’m Charlotte Maanianu Seyab, a backend-focused full-stack web developer with a strong foundation in server-side technologies like Node.js, Express, and databases such as MongoDB. While I’m proficient in front-end development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, my true expertise lies in building scalable, secure, and efficient back-end systems. <br> I specialize in creating APIs, managing databases, and ensuring smooth communication between front-end and back-end components. <br>

                With a background in social work, I bring a unique user-centered approach to my projects, ensuring that the solutions I develop are both functional and impactful. I’m continually expanding my knowledge in advanced backend technologies and aim to work on projects that challenge me to build robust, data-driven applications.</p>
